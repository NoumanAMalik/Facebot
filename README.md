# Facebot
## Submission for WinHacks 2022

### Main Idea
A discord bot to help people connect with each other based on common interests wihtin a server

### What the bot will do
 - Inside a server a user will be able to call a command to make connections
 - The bot will then make a dm with the user and ask the user questions (collecting all the information needed)
 - After the user has answered all the questions, the bot will then add the user to the database and then start checking for connections
 - When a connection is made, the bot will make a dm with the 2 people that the conenction was made and then show each person a hidden message about why the connection was made

### What questions the bot will ask
